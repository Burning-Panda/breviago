**Section 1. Enterprise and Commercial Service Use**

**1.1 Definitions.**  
1.1.1 “Software” means the code and associated documentation covered by this license.  
1.1.2 “Enterprise or Commercial Service” means any deployment, distribution, or provision of the Software—whether directly or via API, integration, hosted service, or other mechanism—by an organization for the benefit of more than one end user or for any revenue-generating purpose.  
1.1.3 “Attributable Revenue” means all gross revenues directly derived from, or materially enhanced by, the Software in an Enterprise or Commercial Service.  
1.1.4 “Developer Contribution” means documented work product (including source code, tests, documentation, issue triage, community support, or integration) performed by a qualified software developer at mid-level seniority or above. Junior-level or recent hires are explicitly excluded from fulfilling this obligation.  

**1.2 Thresholds.**  
This Section 1 applies if, in any consecutive twelve-month period, the Software is used in an Enterprise or Commercial Service that either:(a) directly or indirectly supports more than one hundred (100) distinct end users; or (b) generates Attributable Revenue in excess of fifty thousand U.S. dollars (USD 50,000).  

**1.3 Contribution Obligation.**  
1.3.1 Once a Threshold is met, the organization shall, on an annual basis, make a Contribution equal to one percent (1%) of Attributable Revenue.  
1.3.2 Such Contribution may be furnished in any one, or combination, of the following:  
(a) Cash: payment of 1% of Attributable Revenue;  
(b) Developer Contribution: allocation of Developer Contribution hours valued at USD 130 per hour, where the total dollar value of hours contributed equals 1% of Attributable Revenue; or  
(c) Hybrid: any mix of cash and Developer Contribution whose combined value meets or exceeds 1% of Attributable Revenue.

**1.4 Documentation & Reporting.**  
1.4.1 Annual Plan. At the commencement of each fiscal year, the organization shall publish a Contribution Plan on a clearly-labeled page of its official website or public source-code repository, and a link to the plan on the maintainers' website. The Plan must specify the chosen contribution option(s) and, if applicable, the number of Developer Contribution hours.  
1.4.2 Quarterly or Annual Reports. Organizations exceeding USD 250,000 in annual Attributable Revenue shall report quarterly. Organizations below this threshold may opt to report annually. Reports shall detail (a) cash paid to date and (b) Developer Contribution hours delivered to date, with sufficient detail to verify compliance.

**1.5 Anti-Circumvention.**  
Any attempt to avoid the Thresholds or Contribution Obligation—whether by splitting users, services, revenue streams, or legal entities under common control—shall be deemed a material breach of this license.

**1.6 Exemptions.**  
1.6.1 The Contribution Obligation does not apply to:(a) Individual students, student organizations, or researchers using the Software strictly for non-commercial, academic purposes; or(b) Projects formally exempted in writing under Section 1.6.2.  
1.6.2 Exemption Process. Any open-source project or researcher may apply for exemption by submitting a written request to the Software maintainers that includes: (i) a description of the project’s purpose, (ii) confirmation of non-commercial intent, and (iii) anticipated duration of use. Maintainers shall grant or deny such requests within thirty (30) days of receipt and shall review any granted exemption on an annual basis.

**1.7 Enforcement & Grace Period.**  
Organizations crossing the threshold for the first time are granted a one-time grace period of ninety (90) days to comply. Failure to comply thereafter with the Contribution Obligation, Documentation & Reporting requirements, or Anti-Circumvention provision constitutes a material breach, entitling the maintainers to terminate license rights, seek injunctive relief, or impose remedial obligations including back-payments.

**1.8 Dispute Resolution.**  
In case of disputes arising from this clause, organizations must first engage in good-faith negotiations or mediation with the maintainers prior to pursuing legal remedies.
